<a id="more"></a>
<ul>
<li>Bipolar plates: introduce gaseous reactants to the active heart of the cell, harvest the generated electric current, transport the by-produced water and permit controlling the cell temperature.<br>
</li>
<li>Gas diffusion layer (GDL): ensure effectively reactants diffusion, conduct electrons, and assist in proper water management.<br>
</li>
<li>Catalyst layer (CL)： help the electrochemical reactions<br>
</li>
<li>Proton exchange membrane (PEM): transports proton while prohibits electron conduction.<br>
</li>
<li>Microporous layer (MPL): aviod flooding. MPL is added in the GDL to build a dual-layer GDL.</li>
</ul>
<p>General. the PEM, CLs, and GDLs comprise an assembly that is usually called the membrane electrode assemble (MEA). The PEM is the core component of PEMFCs. In 1970s, a sulfonated poly-tetrafluoro-ethylene based cation-exchange membrane was first developed by DuPont, named as Nafion, which not only exhibited a two-fold increase in proton conductivity but also extended the lifetime by four orders of magnitued. Since then, this Nafion film soon became a standard for PEMFCs and remains so till today.</p>
<h2 id="reactions-in-pemfcs">Reactions in PEMFCs</h2>
<h3 id="hydrogen-oxidation-reaction-hor">Hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR)</h3>
<p>The overall half-cell reaction at the anode is hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR): <span class="math display">\[H_2 \rightleftharpoons 2H^+ + 2e^- \tag{1}\]</span> The above equation occurs successive steps. Here, we use ‘M’ to represent an active Pt atom site, ‘<span class="math inline">\(e^-\)</span>’ to represent an electron. These steps are<br>
Tafel step: <span class="math display">\[H_2+2M \rightleftharpoons H_{ad} + H_{ad} \tag{2}\]</span> Heyrovsky step: <span class="math display">\[H_2 \rightleftharpoons H^+ + H_{ad} + e^- \tag{3}\]</span> Volmer step: <span class="math display">\[H_{ad} \rightleftharpoons H^+ + e^- \tag{4}\]</span> It is worth noting that the Tafel step and the Heyrovsky step are in parallel and either ore or both of them may occur. However, the Volmer step must always occur for the successfully overall reaction.</p>
<h3 id="oxygen-reduction-reaction-orr">Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)</h3>
<p>The overall reaction: <span class="math display">\[O_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^- \rightleftharpoons 2H_2O \tag{5}\]</span> The real reaction is composed by several series or direct steps, as shown below.</p>
<img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/FuelCell(PEMFC)/ORRmechanism.png">
<p>The corresponding exchange current density of ORR can be six-order smaller than that of HOR. As a result, the ORR contribute the major part of activation loss in PEMFCs.</p>
<h3 id="side-reactions">Side reactions</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Pt dissolution<br>
Under certain conditions, such as high potential (&gt;0.9 V vs. RHE), the Pt particles can be oxidized to <span class="math inline">\(Pt^{2+}\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[Pt+H_2O \rightleftharpoons PtO + 2H^+ + 2e^- \tag{6}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[PtO + 2H^+ \rightleftharpoons H_2O + Pt^{2+} \tag{7}\]</span> Following the dissolution, migration and agglomeration of Pt ions may occur, resulting in a loss in the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA).</p></li>
<li><p>Carbon corrosion <span class="math display">\[C + 2H_2O \rightleftharpoons CO_2 + 4H^+ + 4e^- \tag{8}\]</span> The equilibrium potential of the above reaction is 0.207 V (vs. RHE), indicating the carbon corrosion reaction is thermodynamically possible during PEMFC normal operating conditions. However, kinetically, the carbon corrosion rates at typical operating conditions are very slow. In some extrem condition, like start/stop cycles or open-circuit duration, the high voltage in the cathode will accelerate the rate significally.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="thermodynamics-and-kinetics-in-pemfcs">Thermodynamics and kinetics in PEMFCs</h2>
<h3 id="thermodynamics">Thermodynamics</h3>
<p>The reversible (theoretically maximum possible) cell potential <span class="math inline">\(E_r (V)\)</span>, can be calculated as <span class="math display">\[E_r=- \frac{\Delta g}{nF}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta g\)</span> (J mol-1) is the change of Gibbs free energy of the overall reaction per mole of hydrogen, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (=2) the number of moles of electrons transferred per mole of hydrogen, and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> (=96,487 <span class="math inline">\(C mol^{-1}\)</span>) the Faraday’s constant.<br>
Since the change of Gibbs free energy represents the maximum useful work avaliable from the reaction, the thermal (theoretically maximum possible) efficiency, <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{th}\)</span>, can be defined as<br>
<span class="math display">\[\eta_{th}=\frac{\Delta g}{\Delta h}=1-\frac{T \Delta s}{\Delta h}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta h\)</span> is the change of enthalpy of the overall reaction per mole of hydrogen, T the temperature (K), and <span class="math inline">\(\Delta s\)</span> the change of entropy of the overall reaction per mole of hydrogen. By using the above eqution, the thermal efficiency can be calculated to be 83% at 25 °C with product water in liquid state. Practical fuel cells can have efficiency close to this theoretical maximum efficiency, while practical heat engines are very difficult to achieve even about 50% of the theoretical maximum (or Carnot) efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="kinetics">Kinetics</h3>
<p>Even though the OCV predicted from thermodynamics is 1.229 V (298 K), the actual voltage is much less than this value. Generally, the overpotential can be divided into four categories. (1) Voltage loss due to the fuel crossover and internal currents, <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{cro}\)</span>. (2) Activation loss at the three-phase boundary due to the sluggishness of the electrochemical reactions, <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{act}\)</span>. (3) Ohmic loss due to the transport of electrons and protons, <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{ohm}\)</span>. (4) Concentration loss due to the species transport, <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{con}\)</span>. The following figure illustrates the overpotential components in an operating PEMFC.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top-right hint--error hint--large" data-aria-label="[Water transport in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360128510000511)

<img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/FuelCell(PEMFC)/PolarizationCurveofPEMFC.png">
<ul>
<li>The fuel crossover and internal currents are the waste of fuel passing and electron conduction through the electrolyte, respectively. Ideally, the electrolyte should only transport protons, however very small amount of fuel diffusion and electron flow will always be possible.<br>
</li>
<li>The activation loss is caused by the slowness of the reactions taking place on the surface of the electrodes. A proportion of the voltage generated is lost in driving the electrochemical reaction that transfers the electrons and protons to or from the electrode.

<h1 id="water-management">Water management</h1>
<h2 id="origin-and-importance-of-water-management">Origin and importance of water management</h2>
<p>The major cause of the water management issue is the proton conductor - the membrane. Currently, the mostly widely used membrance is the perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymer membrane, among which Nafion membrane is the most famous. The PFSA polymer membranes have acceptable proton conductivity <strong>only when they are well hydrated</strong>. In order to hydrate the membrane, humidified reactant gases are often supplied. However, due to the water production from the electrochemical reactions, as well as the low operating temperature of PEMFC (~ 80 °C) that leads to the almost unavoidable water condensation, liquid water may be present and flood the electrode pore regions, giving rise to the so-called <em>water flooding phenomena</em>. The water flooding is most severe in cathode CL due to the fact that water is produced in this layer and the electro-osmotic drag (EOD) also causes water migrating from anode CL to cathode CL.<br>
Therefore, proper membrane hydration without causing electrode ﬂooding by water, commonly referred to as water management, remains one of the major technical challenges of PEMFC, and maintaining the dynamic balance of water in the cell during operation is essential for better water management and stable performance.</p>
<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>The simplest way to avoid the water ﬂooding is to operate PEMFC on non-humidiﬁed inlet gases with acceptable performance degradation. This requires fuel cells operate below 60°C, which limits electrochemical reaction kinetics and membrane conductivity.<br>
</li>
<li>External humidiﬁcation using liquified gases or external devices to inject water vapor into membrane.<br>
</li>
<li>The excessive water needs to be removed or balanced to avoid the water flooding problem and to better hydrate the membrane. Generally, water is removed by pumping air into cathode flow fields. The GDL and CL properties such as thickness, porosity, permeability, wettability, catalyst loading (for CL) and ionomer fraction (for CL) have strong impacts on water removal. One common way is to add polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) to these layers to increase the hydrophobic level to expel water, and <strong>inserting a hydrophobic microporous layer (MPL) between GDL and CL in cathode was also found to be an effective way to push water from cathode CL into membrane [31-34, 41-45]</strong>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top-right hint--error hint--large" data-aria-label="[Water transport in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360128510000511)

<ul>
<li>The microporous layer provides a transition between the large-scale porosity (10-30 <span class="math inline">\(\mu m\)</span> pores) of the GDL and the fine-scale porosity (10-100 nm pores) of the catalyst layer. The microporous layer can also improve the wicking of liquid water from the catalyst layer and decrease the electrical contact resistance betwen the GDL and the catalyst layer.</li>

<h2 id="state-of-water">State of water</h2>

<h3 id="in-membrane">In membrane</h3>
<p>The most suitable classification of the water in ionomer is non-frozen water and forzen water. The non-frozen water can be further classified into non-freezable, freezable and free water, based on how tight they are bond to the sulphuric acids (<span class="math inline">\(H^+SO_3^-\)</span>). The water absorption level of ionomer is often represented as the number of water molecules per <span class="math inline">\(SO_3^-\)</span> referred to as the water content (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>). (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>=20 in a well hydrated Nafion membrane). An empirical correlation to calculate the maximum allowed amount of non-frozen water content has been given:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lambda_{sat} \begin{cases} =4.834,  &amp; \text{T&lt;223.15 K} \\ =[-1.304+0.01479T-3.594 \times 10^{-5} T^2]^{-1}, &amp; \text{if 223.15 K $\leq$ T&lt;$T_N$ } \\ &gt; \lambda_{nf}, &amp; \text{if T $\geq$ $T_N$}  \\ \end{cases}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{sat}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{nf}\)</span> are the saturation and non-frozen water content; and T and <span class="math inline">\(T_N\)</span> are the local temperature and the normal freezing temperature of water (273.15 K). It has been found that there is a certain amount of water (about <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>=4.8) that does not freeze.</p>
<p>The proton conductivity of Nafion ionomer can be calculated using non-frozen water content (rather than the total water content).<br>
<span class="math display">\[\kappa_{ion}=(0.5130\lambda_{nf}-0.326) exp[1268(\frac{1}{303.15}-\frac{1}{T})]\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_{ion}\)</span> is the proton conductivity and T (K) the temperature. It should be noticed that the equation is originally correlated based on experimental measurements between 30°C and 80 °C.</p>
<h3 id="in-gas-diffusion-layer">In gas diffusion layer</h3>
<p>The GDL is usually carbon paper or carbon cloth, and the porosity is around or higher than 0.5. Water can exist in the pore regions of GDL in the forms of vapor, liquid and ice. The transition amoung them depends on temperature and pressure. The saturation pressure of water and temperature can be calculated as follow. <span class="math display">\[log_{10}(P_{sat}/101325)=-2.1794+0.02953(T-273.15)-9.1837\times 10^{-5}(T-273.15)^2+1.4454 \times 10^{-7} (T-273.15)^3\]</span></p>
<h3 id="in-catalyst-layer">In catalyst layer</h3>
<p>The most complex scenario occurs in CL. The carbon and platinum particles have to be present as the catalyst and for electron transport, and the ionomer has to be present for proton transport. The volume fraction of the ionomer in CL ranges from about 0.2 to 0.4, and the porosity of the CL ranges from about 0.2 to 0.5. The thickness of CL is tpically around 0.01 mm.<br>
The state of water in the pore regions of CL is the same as in the pore regions of GDL. The water in the ionomer of CL is also the same as in the membrane. The following equaiton can be used to indicate the mass transfer (phase change) direction between the water in the ionomer and the vapor/liquid in the pore regions: <span class="math display">\[\lambda_{equil} \begin{cases} =0.043+17.81a-39.85a^2+36.0a^3,  &amp; \text{if 0 $\leq$ a $\leq$ 1} \\ =14.0+1.4(a-1), &amp; \text{if 1&lt;a $\leq$ 3} \\ \end{cases}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{equil}\)</span> is the equilibrium water content (the water content in ionomer corresponding to the amount of surrounding water), and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> the water activity in the pore regions, defined as <span class="math display">\[a=\frac{X_{vp} P_g}{P_{sat}}+2s_{lq}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(X_{vp}\)</span> is the mole fraction of water vapor in the pore regions, <span class="math inline">\(P_g (Pa)\)</span> the pressure of the gas mixture in the pore regions, <span class="math inline">\(P_{sat}(Pa)\)</span> the water saturation pressure, and <span class="math inline">\(s_{lq}\)</span> the liquid water volume fraction in the pore regions.<br>
Here are some reasonable assumptions to simplify the problem. (1) The phase change between the non-frozen membrane water and vapor occurs when non-humidified inlet gases are supplied; (2) only the phase change between the non-frozen membrane water and liquid occurs in cathode CL with fully humidified inlet gases; and (3) only the phase change between the non-frozen membrane water and vapor occurs in anode CL no matter the inlet gases are humidified or not, due to the fact that water is not produced in anode and the EOD effect dries out the anode.</p>
<img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/FuelCell(PEMFC)/FourRegions.png">
<p>Two important concept: (1) equilibrium water content (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{equil}\)</span>), which indicates the phase change between the non-frozen water in the ionomer of CL and the vapor in the pores of CL; (2) saturation water content (<span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{sat}\)</span>), which indicates the phase change between the nonfronzen water in the ionomer and the ice in the pores of CL or the forzen water in the membrane layr. The principal driving forces for these water phase change processes in the CL are the differences between the non-frozen water content in the ionomer and the equilibrium water content, and between the non-frozen water content and the saturation water content.</p>
<h3 id="in-flow-channel">In flow channel</h3>
<p>The state of water in ﬂow channel is similar to as in GDL. The chance of ice formation in ﬂow channel is much lower than in CL and GDL, and might be neglected.</p>
<h2 id="mechanism-of-water-transport">Mechanism of water transport</h2>
<h3 id="in-membrane-1">In membrane</h3>
<p>The following figure shows the structure of Nafion membrane. <img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/FuelCell(PEMFC)/NafionStructure.png"></p>
<h4 id="proton-transport">Proton transport</h4>
<p>The proton transport has significant influence on the water transport in membrane; on the other hand, the proton transport also largely depends on the membrane environment (water content).<br>
As shown in the figure below, at the low water content, the water in the membrane is mostly likely bound to the slide chains. This kind of water may be classiﬁed as the non-freezable water or surface water. This part of water is strongly bound to the charged sites (<span class="math inline">\(SO_3^-\)</span>). In this scenario, proton has to transfer through the void volume from one charged site to another. <img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/FuelCell(PEMFC)/Micro-structuralFeaturesOfNafion.png"></p>
<p>There are three types of proton transfer mechanism: (1) side chanin viberation; (2) vehicle mechanism (also called the vehicular diffusion); (3) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grotthuss_mechanism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hopping mechanism</a> (also called the Grotthuss mechanism or structure diffusion).<br>
- If no water is present in a membrane, the proton can only transfer directly between the charged sites (mechanism 1), resulting low proton conductivity.<br>
- If a little amount of water is present but the amoutn is below the percolation threshold, the proton transfer mechanisms will be mainly the direct transfer between the charged sites (mechanism 1) and vehicle mechanism (mechanism 2).<br>
- When the amount of water is high than the percolation thrshold, the dominating proton transport mechanisms are the vehicle and hopping mechanisms. It has been reported that for intermediate and low hydration levels, the vehicle mechanism (mechanism 2) stil dominates the proton tranport, and for water content higher than 13, the hopping mechanism (mechanism 3) dominates.</p>
<h4 id="diffusion-of-water">Diffusion of water</h4>
<p>The diffusional non-frozen water flux in membrane due to the concentration gradient is a vector quantity and can be written as <span class="math display">\[J_{nmw,diff}=-D_{nmw} \nabla c_{nmw} = -\frac{\rho_{mem}}{EW}D_{nmw} \nabla \lambda_nf\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(D_{nmw} \text{ ($m^2S^{-1}$)}\)</span> is the diffusion coefficient of non-forzen water in membrane, <span class="math inline">\(c_nmw \text{ $kmol m^{-3}$}\)</span> the non-frozen water concentration in membrane, <span class="math inline">\(\rho_{mem} \text{ ($kg m^{-3}$)}\)</span> the density of dry membrane, and <span class="math inline">\(EW \text{ $kg kmol^{-1}$}\)</span> the equivalent weight.<br>
The diffusion coefficient is sensitively dependent on the membrane hydration. However, the relation between the diffusiion coefficient and water content in Nafion is still in debate and two different correlations are both being applied in fuel cell modeling. But both model show that the maximum diffusion coefficient occurs at the water content of 3, casued by the transformation of the diffusion coefficient.</p>
<h4 id="electro-osmotic-drag-effect">Electro-osmotic drag effect</h4>
<p>The EOD coefficient, <span class="math inline">\(n_d\)</span>, depends on the water content of membrane. The most important factor is that protons tranveling through the pores of Nafion generally drag water molecules along with them. Actually, protons travel in the form of hydronium complexes (<span class="math inline">\(H_3O^+\)</span>) or something similar. The straightforward defination of EOD coefficient is the number of water molecules per proton. The water flux due to the EOD is <span class="math display">\[J_{nmw,EOD}=n_d \frac{I_{ion}}{F}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(I_{ion} \text{ ($A m^{-2}$)}\)</span> is the ionic current density, and <span class="math inline">\(F \text{ ($9.6487 \times 10^7 C kmol^{-1}$)}\)</span> the Faraday’s constant.<br>
The value of <span class="math inline">\(n_d\)</span> is also still in debet and different values are applied in different models.</p>
<h4 id="hydraulic-permeation">Hydraulic permeation</h4>
<p>The water flux associated with the hydraulic permeation of water due to pressure gradient is <span class="math display">\[J_{nmw,hyd}=-c_{nmw} \frac{K_{nmw}}{\mu_{nmw}} \nabla p_{nwm}=-\lambda_{nf} \frac{\rho_{mem}}{EW} \frac{K_{nmw}}{\mu_{lq}} \nabla p\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(K_{nmw} \text{ ($m^2$)}\)</span> is the permeability of non-frozen water in ionomer, <span class="math inline">\(c_{nmw} \text{ ($kmol m^{-3}$)}\)</span> the non-frozen water concentration in ionomer, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{nmw} \text{ ($kg m^{-1}s^{-1}$)}\)</span> the dynamic viscosity of non-frozen water in ionomer (the property of liquid is often used instead), and <span class="math inline">\(p_{nmw} \text{ (Pa)}\)</span> the pressure of non-frozen water in ionomer.<br>
Generally, the permeability is very low (<span class="math inline">\(K_{nmw}=2.86 \times 10^{-20} \lambda_{nf}\)</span>). In order to provide additional means for the reduction of water in the cathode and hydrate the membrane close to the anode, cells may be differentially pressureized such that the oxidant gas is supplied at a higher pressure than the fuel gas in the anode.</p>
<h4 id="reactant-transport">Reactant transport</h4>
<p>The transport of reactants through the membrane is usually neglected in PEMFC studies becasue of low diffusion coefficients of reactant gases in membrane (about <span class="math inline">\(10^{-6}\)</span> of the bulk diffusion coefficients).</p>
<h3 id="in-gas-diffusion-layer-1">In gas diffusion layer</h3>
<p>Carbon paper or carbon cloth with thicknesses between 0.2 and 0.4 mm is widely used as the GDL becasue of the high porosity (usually higher than 0.5) that facilitates the reactant transport towards the catalyst sites. To help removing water from electrode, the carbon paper or carbon cloth is usually treated to be hydrophobic by coating a layer of PTFE on them to expel water.</p>
<h4 id="diffusion-and-convection">Diffusion and convection</h4>
<p>In GDL and CL, the ﬂow exhibits porous and tortuous structures on the micro- and nanometre length scales, in which the convective forces are resisted. As a result, the ﬂow in GDL can be diffusion dominated, convection dominated, or mixed, depending on the design of the ﬂow channel. For example, in the following figure, diffusion dominates in the parallel flow channel design, both diffusion and convection could be dominated in the serpentine flow channel design, while convection dominates in the interdigitated design. <img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/FuelCell(PEMFC)/FlowCharacteristicsinGDL.png?imageMogr2/thumbnail/500x500"></p>
<p>The GDL and CL are porous and tortuous, the effective diffusion coefficient based on porosity and tortuosity is <span class="math display">\[D_i^{eff}=D_i \frac{\varepsilon}{\tau}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(D_i^{eff}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_i\)</span> represent the effective and bulk diffusion coefficients of gas species i, respectively; and <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> are the porosity and tortuosity of GDL or CL, respectively. The porosity is deﬁned as the percentage of void volume in the total volume, the tortuosity describes the additional impedance to diffusion caused by a tortuous or convoluted ﬂow path.</p>
<p>The Bruggeman correlation provides the relationship between porosity and tortuosity as <span class="math display">\[\tau=\varepsilon^{-0.5}\]</span> Therefore, the diffusion coefficient equation can be expressed as <span class="math display">\[D_i^{eff}=D_i \varepsilon^{1.5}\]</span></p>
<h4 id="surface-tension-and-wall-adhesion-effects-in-porous-media-capillary-effect">Surface tension and wall adhesion effects in porous media: capillary effect</h4>
<p>Surface tension can be understood as the force acting to minimize the free energy (minimize the forces at the interface) by decreasing the area of the interface, resulting in the droplet squeezing itself together until it has the locally lowest surface area possible. The surface tension coefficient (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(N m^{-1}\)</span>), pressure difference (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta p\)</span>, Pa) and surface curvature can be related by the Young-Laplace equation. <span class="math display">\[\Delta p = \sigma (\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2})\]</span> where the surface curvature is represented by the two radii of the curved surface in two orthogonal directions. <img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/FuelCell(PEMFC)/SurfaceWettabilities.png"> The surface tension effect plays an important role in liquid water transport in PEMFC. In GDL (and CL), liquid water transport is strongly affected by the pore walls due to the samll pore size, and the wall adhesion effect becomes significant in this scenario. Therefore, a hydrophobic surface is needed becasue it is more effective in facilitating liquid transport than a hydrophilic surface due to the reduced contact area between liquid and wall.<br>
The capillary pressure in small pores can be simplified as <span class="math display">\[p_c=p_g-p_{lq}=\frac{2 \sigma}{R} = \frac{2 \sigma}{d/(2cos \theta)} = \frac{4 \sigma_{lq} cos \theta}{d}\]</span> The capillary pressure is an important parameter affecting liquid water transport in PEMFC.</p>
<h4 id="condensation-and-evaporation-of-water">Condensation and evaporation of water</h4>
<p>The net mass transfer of the evaporation and condensation can be estimated using the Hertz-Knudsen-Langmuir equation. But a comprehensive investigation of the condensation and evaporation process is rather complicated. For the sake of simplicity, for PEMFC modeling on the macroscopic level, a revised form is generally used <span class="math display">\[S_{v-1}=\frac{A_{vp/lq}\zeta_{ce}}{RT}(p_{vp}-p_{sat})\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(S_{v-1}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(kg m^{-3} s^{-1}\)</span>) is the mass transfer rate of phase change between vapor and liquid water, <span class="math inline">\(A_{vp/lq}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(m^{-1}\)</span>) the liquid/vapor specific interfacial area, <span class="math inline">\(p_{vp}\)</span> (Pa) the vapor water pressure. <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_{ce}\)</span> the analogous condensation/evaporation rate and it reads <span class="math display">\[\zeta_{ce}=\Gamma_{ce} sqrt(\frac{RT}{2\pi M_{H_2O}})\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{ce}\)</span> is an uptake coefﬁcient that accounts for the combined effects of heat and mass transport limitations in the vicinity of the liquid/vapour interface.</p>
<p>Since the water phase change rates are strongly affected by the local conditions such as massand heat transfer, the accuracy of the mass transfer rate of phase change calculations on the macroscopic level remains debated.</p>
<h3 id="in-catalyst-layer-1">In catalyst layer</h3>
<p>With the presence of both the pore regions and ionomer, the most complex water transport occurs in CL. All the processes that happened in the membrance and GDL could happen in CL. The Knudsen numbers (<span class="math inline">\(Kn_g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Kn_{lq}\)</span>) for both the gas and liquid phases can be calculated by the following equation. <span class="math display">\[Kn_g=\frac{l_g}{d}=\frac{\mu_g}{p_g} \sqrt {\frac{\pi R T}{2 M_g d}}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[Kn_{lq}=\frac{\delta_{lq}^{lattice}}{d}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(l_g\)</span> (m) is the mean free path of gas phase, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> (m) the pore diameter, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_g\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(kg m^{-1} s^{-1}\)</span>) the dynamics viscosity of gas phase, <span class="math inline">\(p_g\)</span> (Pa) the pressure of gas phase, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> the universal gas constant, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (K) the temperature, <span class="math inline">\(M_g\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(kg kmol^{-1}\)</span>) the molecular weight of gas phase, and <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{lq}^{lattice}\)</span> the average distance between liquid water lattice.<br>
In fuel cell, the Knudsen numbers for gas and liquid water are about 8.2 and 0.03, respectively, suggesting that the macroscopic top-down approach cannot be used with the real micro-structure of CL (also cannot be used with the nanometre pores in membrane).<br>
The water transfer between the ionomer and pore regions in CL (membrane water adsorption/desorption) plays an important role in PEMFC becasue it determines the hydration/dehydration of membrane. The PFSA polymer membrane surface is strongly hydrophobic when it is in contact with water vapor, and it becomes hydrophilic when in contact with liquid water, as shown below. <img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/FuelCell(PEMFC)/PFSAhydrophilic-hydrophobic.png"></p>
<p>The humidification of the ionomer is a very slow process, especially with water vapor. It takes 100-1000 s to reach its absorption equilibrium state in humid air. In addition, studies show the physical mechanism of membrane absorption is different from that of desorption, which is mainly limited by the interfacial mass transport. Water absorption process presents a two-step behaviour: the initial 35% of water absorption is described by the same interfacial transport rate coefﬁcient as that of desorption, while for the value above 35%, water absorption is controlled by the dynamics of membrane swelling and relaxation. It is found that the absorption process is 10 times slower than that of desorption in the second stage.</p>
<h3 id="in-flow-channel-1">In flow channel</h3>
<p>Flow channel provides pathways for distributing reactant and removing product water in PEMFC. The ﬂow in ﬂow channel is convection dominated, and the driving force is the pressure at the ﬂow channel inlets. The flow in flow channel is mostly likely laminar.</p>
<h1 id="catalyst">Catalyst</h1>

<p>PEMFC electrocatalyst technology has relied almost exclusively on either Pt blacks or Pt nanoparticles, 2-5 nm in size, dispersed onto larger carbon black particles. The basic designs for platinum catalysts can be divided into four categories by overall geometry of the catalyst and its support. Here are some definitions for a better understanding of this topic<br>
- Surface-area enhancement factor: the Pt catalyst surface area S measured by the charge generated from an under-potential deposited monolayer of hydrogen atoms on the Pt catalyst surface divided by the planar area of the sample (<span class="math inline">\(cm^2\)</span> Pt per planar <span class="math inline">\(cm^2\)</span>)<br>
- Pt loading: the number of mg of Pt per planar <span class="math inline">\(cm^2\)</span> in an MEA electrode layer.<br>
- Absolute ORR kinetic activity: the current density measured at 900 mV under one atmosphere of fully saturated pure oxygen, at 80 ℃. For MEA this means 150 kPa absolute pressure, due to 50 kPa of water vapor.<br>
- Area-specific activity <span class="math inline">\(A_s\)</span> [A per <span class="math inline">\(cm^2\)</span> Pt]: divide the absolute activity by the surface-area enhancement factor. The DOE’s 2015 target is 0.7 mA per <span class="math inline">\(cm^2\)</span> Pt.<br>
- Mass activity <span class="math inline">\(A_m\)</span> [A per mg of Pt]: divide the absolute activity by the Pt loading. The DOE’s 2017 target for <span class="math inline">\(A_m\)</span> is 0.44 A per mg Pt.</p>
<h3 id="extended-surface-area-catalysts">Extended surface area catalysts</h3>
<p>Extended surface area (ESA) catalysts comprise large area surfaces extended in two dimensions like thin films. The area-specific ORR activities (<span class="math inline">\(A_s\)</span>) of ESA catalysts are about ten times higher than nanoparticle-on-carbon catalysts, owing to electronic structure properties of thin films versus nanoparticles. For example, a Pt-skin surface structure on <span class="math inline">\(Pt_3Ni_1\)</span> {111} was reported to have the world-record <span class="math inline">\(A_s\)</span> of 18 mA per <span class="math inline">\(cm^2\)</span> Pt (non-iR corrected), about 90 times higher than a standard commercial dispersed Pt/C in comparative RDE measurements.</p>
<h3 id="nanoparticles-on-low-aspect-ratio-supports">Nanoparticles on low-aspect-ratio supports</h3>
<p>This catalyst category is dominated by roughly spherical Pt or Pt alloy nanoparticles dispersed on standard or graphitized carbon black support particles, in cluding conventional homogeneous Pt and Pt transition-metal alloy nanoparticles and designer nanoparticles with size, shape and radial composition controlled to increase activity and reduce Pt.<br>
The state-of-the-art of conventional Pt and Pt-alloy/C electrocatalysts in dominant use today consist of Pt nanoparticles with diameters of 2–4 nm, dispersed onto larger high-surface-area carbon black support particles at Pt/C weight percentages of 20% to 60%.</p>
<h3 id="nanoparticles-on-high-aspect-ratio-supports">Nanoparticles on high-aspect-ratio supports</h3>
<p>This category includes Pt or Pt-alloy nanoparticles dispersed on standard carbon fibres as well as on single- or multi-walled carbon nanotubes. This is not an attractive tehnique in fuel cells.</p>
<h3 id="unsupported-nanoparticles">Unsupported nanoparticles</h3>
<p>Unsupported nanoparticle catalysts include the traditional low-aspect-ratio particles of Pt and Pt alloy blacks, and new concepts that use Pt and Pt-alloys in the form of high-aspect-ratio structures such as nano-tubes and Pt monolayers on Pd nanowires and nanorods.</p>

<p>Non-precious metal (NPM) catalysts eliminate PGMs completely to reduce costs, and have recently shown dramatic ORR activity improvements. The Dodelet group’s impregnation and pyrolysis process combining Fe precursors and a nitrogen precursor has led to the largest beginning-of-life activity increases. However, the nature of the active site in these NPM catalysts is still debated, as is the question of whether Fe is associated with the active site or with the means of creating such as site. Kinetic activities measured at 0.8 V using pure O2 have rapidly increased from 2.7 <span class="math inline">\(cm^{-3}\)</span> in 2008 (ref. 82), to 99 A <span class="math inline">\(cm^{-3}\)</span> in 2009 (ref. 79), and 230 <span class="math inline">\(cm^{-3}\)</span> in 2011 (ref. 81).</p>

This paper focuses on the performance of a non-precious metal catalyst (NPMC) based on nitroaniline precursors.
<ul>
<li>Catalyst performance is determined by the site-speciﬁc catalytic activity for ORR and by the surface density of these active catalyst centers at the catalyst–membrane (electrolyte) interface. For platinum, every surface platinum atom is potentially a catalytically active site. In the case of non-precious metal catalysts, the catalytic sites of interest are believed to be multi-atomic entities rather than single atoms, the structure of which is not certain. This implies that the surface packing density of multi-atomic catalytic centers will play a crucial role in the total activity of NPMCs. <img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/FuelCell(PEMFC)/3MBestResultInNonPGM_2008.png"></li>

<li>Science, 2009 <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5923/71/tab-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iron-Based Catalysts with Improved Oxygen Reduction Activity in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells</a>: Four factors have been identified as requirements for producing active Fe-based catalysts for ORR: (i) disordered carbon content in the catalyst precursor, (ii) iron, (iii) surface nitrogen, and (iv) micropores in the catalyst. Our present approach, which introduces a new material (pore filler) and replaces impregnation with planetary ball-milling, has elevated the catalytic activity of an Fe-based NPMC by a factor of &gt;35 relative to the previous best reported activity for Fe-based catalysts (and within ~10% of the best Pt-based catalysts).
<ul>
<li>The limiting factor for NPMC loading is electrode thickness, which, if increased beyond ~100 mm, creates unacceptable mass transport losses at high current density, resulting in decreased power density.<br>

<li>Nature Communication, 2011 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iron-based cathode catalyst with enhanced power density in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells</a>: Fe-based cathode catalysts are promising contenders, but their power density has been low compared with Pt-based cathodes, largely due to poor mass-transport properties. Here we report an iron-acetate/phenanthroline/zeolitic-imidazolate-framework-derived electrocatalyst with increased volumetric activity and enhanced mass-transport properties. A cathode made with the best electrocatalyst from this work, tested in H2-O2, has a power density of 0.75 W cm−2 at 0.6 V, a meaningful voltage for polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cells operation, comparable with that of a commercial Pt-based cathode tested under identical conditions.
<ul>
<li>The vast majority of the over-twofold increase in current density at 0.6 V can only be explained by improved mass-transport properties of the catalyst or the catalyst-ionomer layer structure. <img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/FuelCell(PEMFC)/BestResultIn2011.png"></li>

<p>Three categories of NPM catalysts have been developed, i.e. biomimetic heme-copper oxidase enzymes, non-pyrolyzed/polymeric system, and pyrolyzed NPM-nitrogen-doped carbon (M-N/C) (M = Fe, Ni, Co, etc.) catalysts. Among all these NPM-based catalysts studied, M-N/C-based catalysts have shown very promising results.</p>
