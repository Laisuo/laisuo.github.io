So how do the birds keep their hearing? Research found out that when a rooster’s beak is fully open, as it is when crowing, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944200617301976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a quarter of the ear cannal completely closes and soft tissue covers 50% of the eardrum</a>.

An experiment above Idaho suggests humans can turbocharge snowfall</a>: It has been proposed by atmospheric scientific Bernard Vonnegut that particles of silver iodide can cause supercool clouds of water vapor to freeze into snow in the lab in the 1940s. However, it takes 80 years to identify the chain of events from seeding to precipitation on the groud. The difficulties includes (1) Instrucments of decades past couldnot measure water droplet size in clouds, which makes scientists unsure wheter the silver iodide was doing anthing at all. (2) It is impossible to repeat experiment becasue you’ll never have the same atmospheric conditions again. Today, Friedrich and her colleagues applied new instruments and found the evidence that silver iodide do help.</p></li>

Isn’t it cool? The idea of this “Smart windows”have been around for decades actually. But it failed to make a broad impact in the building market because of it high cost, inconsisteencies in its ability to block outside light and the demand for external electrical power. Recently, Perovskites attract researchers attention, and the first advance in combining all features came in November 2017 when researchers (chemist Nathan Neale and mechanical engineer Lance Wheeler) report they had created a lead-based perovskit solar window that switched from transparent to opaque when the temperature hit 60°C. The problem is that the efficiency of the solar cells drops after only a few times switching back and forth, probabably becasue the methylamine fails to fully return the perovskit to its starting crystalline arrangement. Recently, Peidong Yang beat them by reporting that his team has created a cesium-based perovskit solar window that turns oaque and produces electricity when heated, but without methylamine. <img src="http://p2nx95frv.bkt.gdipper.com/images/4th-week-reading-in-2018/SolarWindow.jpg?imageMogr2/thumbnail/300x300"></p></li>

But its sudden collapse would doom the planet</a>: To stave off the heat, some scientists have proposed blanketing Earth in a sheet of sunlight-reflecting particles called aerosols. This solar shield could cool the planet and buy us time, but a new study suggests that if politicians turned off the hypothetical cloud, they could plunge the planet into a sudden ecological Armageddon. (The scene of the ending of the world that happens in movie suddenly shows up in my mind after reading this article)</p></li>

Lenses with pliable, transparent electronics can measure glucose levels from tears in the eye—and warn wearers if they get too high. The lenses have been tested only in animals. But if they work in people, they could offer diabetics a pain-free way to monitor when and whether their glucose levels go out of whack, something that could send them tumbling into a coma, or worse.<br>

Today, the rocket fired its engines in a test at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, clearing the way for an inaugural launch in the coming weeks. The business case for Falcon Heavy involves taking commercial satellites cheaply to low-Earth orbit, and sending tourists on slingshots around the moon. Other possible targets for Falcon Heavy include Saturn’s moons Titan and Enceladus and the ice giants Neptune and Uranus. Astronomers are also thinking about what heavy lift can do for them.</p></li>

This year, Li and colleagues intend to start building a 100-PW laser known as the Station of Extreme Light (SEL). By 2023, it could be flinging pulses into a chamber 20 meters underground, subjecting targets to extremes of temperature and pressure not normally found on Earth, a boon to astrophysicists and materials scientists alike. The laser could also power demonstrations of a new way to accelerate particles for use in medicine and high-energy physics.<br>

Wu et al. tackle this issue by determining the underlying mechanisms in unprocessed magnesium alloys. Dilute amounts of solutes enhanced certain ductility-improving mechanisms over ones that cause brittle fracture. From this, the authors developed a theory that may be helpful for screening the large number of potential magnesium alloy compositions.</p>

And more scientists must respond to the very real need to assess and understand the implications, in the same way as those before them have done so admirably on the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and drugs.</p></li>

The researchers first confirmed that Ophiocoma could respond to visual cues. “Not only do they move away from light, but they can pick out a dark shade at a distance of about 40 centimetres and move towards it very rapidly”. “Sensing the environment and responding to a stimulus without having to wait for that signal to go all the way to the brain can save a lot of time,” Sigwart says. And the idea could inspire the development of robots and image-recognition technology that don’t rely on a central control system, she adds.</li>

The studied manufacturing parameters include (1) active material mass loading, (2) calendering stress load, (3) carbon black content; the cathode material includes LMO and NCM. Here are some conclusions. * Among the investigated calendering stress load, the highest calendering configurations yielded the highest discharge capacities, and lowest electronic resistances.<br>
* NMC shows characteristic advantage at low C-rates below 2C, while LMO performs superior at higher C-rates. But this critical value can be shifted by changing calendering stress load.<br>
* Another interesting finding is that calendering enhances the reproducibility of performance among cells for given parameter configurations.</p>
